title: Uploading Files
---

To upload a file in Palmr, the process is very simple. There are two main locations where you can upload files. 
However, before proceeding, it’s important to highlight that the core functionality of Palmr is file sharing. 
But for this to work, you need to first upload one or more files to share. Later, you can create a sharing session, 
which may contain one or multiple files.

Now let's focus on the file upload process. As mentioned, it is very simple, and you can upload files from two locations: 
**the Home Page** or **the My Files Page**. We will go through both examples below, but the process is exactly the same in both cases.

## Home Page

On the home page, there is a **"Recent Uploads"** section. On the first initialization (when no file has been uploaded yet), 
it will appear like this:

![Recent Uploads Section](/src/assets/recent-uploads.png)

To upload a file, simply click on the **"Upload File"** button. This will open a modal where you can select the file you want 
to upload from your device. Some file types, such as images, audio, and video, will have a preview available.

### Example with an image:

After selecting the file, you can either confirm the upload by clicking the **"Upload"** button or cancel the operation by clicking the **"Cancel"** button.

Once one or more files have been uploaded, the **"Recent Uploads"** section will update and look like this:

To upload a new file from this screen, click the **"Upload File"** button in the upper right corner of the section, and follow the same steps as before.

This list on the home page shows only the **last 5 uploads**. To view older files or upload more, you need to go to the **"My Files"** page. 
You can access this by clicking on the **"View All"** button in the upper right corner of the section or by clicking on the **"My Files"** card on the home page.

## My Files Page

On the **"My Files"** page, the layout will look like this:

![My Files Page](/src/assets/my-files-page.png)

Here, you have the option to **filter** your uploaded files or upload new ones by clicking the **"Upload File"** button and following the same steps explained earlier.

Notice that the tables in the **"Recent Files"** section and the **"My Files"** page are the same — the only difference is the number of results shown. 
The **"Recent Files"** section shows only the last 5 uploads, while the **"My Files"** table displays all uploads.

The table fields include:
- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Size**
- **Created At**
- **Updated At**
- **Actions**

### Actions Column
In the **"Actions"** column, you will find an icon that opens the following dropdown:

Each option is self-explanatory, but let’s detail the **Edit** option:

- **Edit** – Opens a modal where you can edit the file name, description, and other details.

- You can also **delete** a file directly from the dropdown by selecting the **Delete** option.

The preview feature is only available for files like images, audio, PDFs and video. For other file types, 
you can download them using the **Download** option in the dropdown.

## Notes and Recommendations

- For a better user experience, we recommend using optimized files for upload.  
- Upload errors or issues are logged and can be reviewed through the admin panel.  
- Admins can manage file access permissions.
