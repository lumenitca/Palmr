title: Palmr. API Endpoints
---

##### Overview of Palmr. API Endpoints  

Palmr. provides a **highly documented and typed API** that can be accessed at:  

- **In a production environment:** `{your_server_domain}/docs`  
- **In a local environment:** [http://localhost:3333/docs](http://localhost:3333/docs)  

The API documentation is powered by **Scalar** ([https://scalar.com](https://scalar.com)), which offers a fully interactive interface for testing all the available requests within Palmr. Below is an example screenshot of the API documentation interface:

### Accessing the API Documentation  

We do **not provide an online version** of the API documentation because it may change depending on the specific version of Palmr. you are using. Therefore, we recommend checking the documentation only after starting your API service. The API service corresponds to the **server** within the official Palmr. GitHub repository.

### Scalar-Based Documentation  

We recommend using **Scalar** for querying and testing the API because the system was designed with Scalar in mind. Scalar offers an intuitive and interactive environment for exploring endpoints, sending requests, and viewing responses directly within the interface.

### Swagger-Based Documentation  

If you prefer not to use Scalar or are more comfortable with an alternative tool, a **Swagger-based version** of the documentation is also available.

You can access it at:  

- **In a production environment:** `{your_server_domain}/swagger`  
- **In a local environment:** [http://localhost:3333/swagger](http://localhost:3333/swagger)  

Both the Scalar and Swagger versions contain the same endpoints and are documented at a level sufficient for testing and integrating with other systems.

Both options ensure that you have all the necessary tools and information to integrate Palmr. with your systems or third-party services effectively.
