Palmr supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, allowing users to sign in using external identity providers such as Google, Zitadel, Auth0, and other OIDC-compliant services. This feature provides seamless single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and centralized user management.

OIDC authentication in Palmr is built using the industry-standard OpenID Connect protocol. The implementation supports automatic user provisioning, and flexible configuration options.

## Why use OIDC authentication?

OIDC authentication provides several advantages for organizations and users:

**Centralized Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their existing organizational credentials without creating separate accounts for Palmr.

**Enhanced Security**: OIDC provides robust security features including token-based authentication, PKCE flow, and standardized protocols.

**Single Sign-On**: Users can access Palmr. seamlessly if they're already authenticated with their identity provider.

**User Management**: Administrators can manage user access centrally through their existing identity provider.

**Compliance**: OIDC helps meet organizational security and compliance requirements by leveraging existing identity infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring OIDC authentication, ensure you have:

- **Administrative Access**: ADMIN privileges in Palmr. to configure OIDC settings
- **Identity Provider**: An OIDC-compliant identity provider (Google, Zitadel, Auth0, etc.)
- **Application Registration**: Your Palmr. application registered with your identity provider
- **OIDC Credentials**: Client ID, Client Secret, and Issuer URL from your identity provider

### Supported identity providers

Palmr's OIDC implementation is compatible with any OpenID Connect compliant provider, including as official providers:

- **[Google](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/google)**
- **[Discord](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/discord)**
- **[Github](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/github)**
- **[Zitadel](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/zitadel)**
- **[Auth0](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/auth0)**
- **[Authentik](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/authentik)**
- **[Frontegg](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/frontegg)**
- **[Kinde Auth](/docs/3.2-beta/oidc-authentication/kinde-auth)**

Although these are the official providers (internally tested with 100% success), you can connect any OIDC provider by providing your credentials and connection URL. We've developed a practical way to integrate virtually all OIDC providers available in the market. In this documentation, you can consult how to configure each of the official providers, as well as include other providers not listed as official. Just below, you will find instructions on how to access the OIDC provider configuration. For specific details about configuring each provider, select the desired option in the sidebar, in the "OIDC Authentication" section.
